COMPLETED:
addresses for variables and array references using symbol table - HANDELLED
expression evaluation(CODING PART) - BASIC HANDELLED
handelling int constants in expression - evaluated only when needed
assignments(without * and &s) // current version is unoptimized, does not directly substitute into stack. it first gets the address in a register and then puts it into stack, also in the end we leave the first register with value of the new assignment

REMAINING:
handelling multi
function activation record handelling
CASTING
handelling the return 
intial stack handelling; setting up the dynamic link and the changing the base pointer
FLOAT CONSTANTS
structs member and pointer
* and &


NOTE: MIPS has 32 bit addressing, need to change the pointer size to 4 instead of 8
